AI Guru Website Testing Project

Project Overview

This project was created to improve my skills in manual and automated testing. The AI Guru website was tested with the permission of the website owner. The project was performed using the Black Box technique - without interfering with the code.
AI Guru is a website that provides information about artificial intelligence technologies and how they can improve people's lives. Its goal is to share knowledge and ideas with visitors who are interested in keeping up with the latest developments.
